# Arduino Bluetooth Car

Made and tested with HC-05 Bluetooth module.

### Arduino ---> L298N
13    --->  IN4
<br>  12    --->  IN3
<br>   8    --->  IN2
<br>   7    --->  IN1
<br>   5    --->  ENA
<br>   3    --->  ENB

The module should already be paired with the phone, after that a connection can be made from within the app between the phone and the bluetooth module.

Upload car.ino to the Arduino board. Connect blutooth module to the board's RX and TX.
